# Simulation-of-scene
Used SIFT for feature detection and pattern recognition part of Computer Vision. The location of the object was determined, with the a pinhole camera as the origin, using a mathematical approach. The simulation of the scene was done in python.

The project is divided into three parts. 
1) Detecting the object from an image and determining it's location to simulate the scene.
2) Fetching a live video being taken from a mobile phone to the laptop and detecting the object and simulating the scene using the video.
3) Using the laptop's webcam for taking a live video and detecting and simulating the scene using that.

Images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, 4_box.jpg, Three.jpg were used as training image. The code can detect distinct multiple images in the same frame and simulate it with an error of less than 1 cm from a distance of 5 meters.
